# Utility-classes
This fork is based on the original sadun-util Utility Classes [from SourceForge]( https://sourceforge.net/projects/sadun-util ) which has being imported to GitHub by the original author Cristiano Sadun.

This library is required by the [JPoller project](https://github.com/crsadun/jpoller) as a dependency.

## Cartago Software Changes

As with our fork of the [JPoller project](https://github.com/Cartago-Software/jpoller) we have removed extraneous classes that are needed for working with JPoller. We have kept the original version number from Mr. Sadun as 1.13.0 but we have given it a qualifier of -CARTAGO to prevent confusion between the original release, and the one we present here. 


The licensing for this code has as per Mr. Sadun's documentation been released under LGPL which are now visible in the source code and the tagged versions.
